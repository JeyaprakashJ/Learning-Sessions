    "Algorithmic thinking is the ability to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller and smaller steps. It is a critical skill for programmers, but it is also useful in many other fields, such as mathematics, engineering, and business.\n",

    "An algorithm is a sequence of instructions that can be followed to solve a problem. Algorithms can be written in natural language, pseudocode, or a programming language.\n"

    "**The steps of algorithmic thinking are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Understand the problem. What is the problem that you are trying to solve? What are the inputs and outputs of the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Brainstorm possible solutions. There may be many different ways to solve a problem. Brainstorm as many possible solutions as you can, even if they seem silly at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Choose a solution and write pseudocode. Once you have chosen a solution, write it down in pseudocode. Pseudocode is a way of writing an algorithm that is not specific to any programming language. This will help you to clarify your thinking and to identify any potential problems with your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Implement the solution in Python. Once you have written the pseudocode, you can implement the solution in Python. This is where you will actually write the code that solves the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Test and debug the solution. Once you have implemented the solution, you need to test it to make sure that it works correctly. You should also debug the code to fix any errors.\n",
